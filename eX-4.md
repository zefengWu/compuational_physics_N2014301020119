*Consider again a decay problem with two types of nuclei A and B,but now suppose that nuclei of type A decay ones of type B,while 
nuclei type of B decay into ones of A.Strictly speaking, this is not a decay process, since it is possible for the type B nuclei to turn
back into type A nuclei. A better analogy would be a resonance in which a system can tunnel or move back and forth between two states A 
and B which have equal energies. The corresponding rate equations are

where for simplicity we have assumed that the two types of decay are characterized by the same time constant, tau. Solve this system of
equation for the numbers of nuclei, NA and NB, as functions of time. Consider different initial conditions, such as NA=100, NB=0, etc,
and take tau=1s. Show that your numerical results are consistent with the idea that the system reaches a steady state in which NA and
NB are constant. In such a steady state, the time derivatives dNA/dt and dNB/dt should vanish.
